proute input file v1,
# The first line is mandatory, must start with "proute input file v", then
# a version number for the file format (so far only v1 exists). The last
# character of the first line is very important: it is used as field separator
# in the following lines.
# Each line starting with a hash sign is ignored, by the way.
# The second line specifies a list of attributes that will be specified for
# each node.
# Specified values will be evaluated in python. This means that acceptable
# values for booleans are True and False. There is a tolerance with strings,
# so it's not mandatory to use quotes. For instance all following three values
# are acceptable: a string 'a string' "a string". The first one will not work
# if space is the separating character though.
ID,x,y,demand,release time,due date,is depot
# After that, each line with the same number of fields specifies information
# for a node; any line starting with the field separator and with two fields
# describes global attributes for this instance.
# The following three lines describe nodes:
depot,0,0,0,0,100,True
customer 1,-12,30,10,10,50,False
customer 2,20,1,10,0,30,False
customer 3,-20,-20,7,10,40,False
customer 4,10,-30,8,30,80,False
# The next two lines describe global instance attributes:
,capacity,20
,maximum length,90
